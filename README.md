# Generics

When writing golang code, there are a series of [immutable, irrefutable laws](https://go-proverbs.github.io/) that you're required to follow. One of these laws states the following:

`interface{} says nothing`

This is why you should avoid programming against it as a replacement for the lack of generics, as it's a meaningless crutch which tells you nothing about the behavior of the types underneath it.

I couldn't agree more.

That's why I've built package generics.

# Say it with T
Package generics exposes a single, powerful type, `T`. With `T`, a golang developer (or gopher, as they like to be called) can confidently and securely rely on the power and flexibility of the built-in `interface{}`, without risking a violation of the core laws and tenets all golang developing gophers are required to adhere to.

# Getting T

First, fetch the code using one of the many different officially sanctioned options for retrieving go code. Find each of them documented below for your convenience:

## go get

`go get github.com/StabbyCutyou/generics`

# Using T

Once you've gotten the code, you can import it like so:

```golang
  import . "github.com/StabbyCutyou/generics"
```

While importing using the dot notation is optional, it is the officially supported method of using package generics, as requiring the developer to type out the word `generics` each time they wish to declare something as being generic is very un-golang. Golang is all about developer productivity, and you can't be productive if you're spending all your time typing out long type declarations.

# T is for Type
With `T`, you can take ugly code signatures like this:

```go
func UglyUnIdiomaticQuoteGenericApproachUnquote(poorexcuse ...interface{}) []interface{}
```

And transform it into the embodiment of meaningful code for which there can be no ambiguity:

```go
func Excellence(things ...T) []T
```

Clearly, the latter example is far superior, as it screams its intent loud and proud: I am `T`, and I am ~generic~ type-safe!

# Backwards Compatibility
`T` meets the standard of golang by matching its stance on backwards compatibility. Until a 2.0 release of generics, which may never happen, `T` will always be 100% backwards compatible with it's initial 1.0 release.

# On Law 8
One possible conflict golang gophers might have is reconciling the use of a small, but well-designed, library such as package generics with Law 8: `A little copying is better than a little dependency.`. So long as all licensing restrictions on the software are adhered to, I have no issue with anyone who wishes to copy, rather than import, the full weight of package generics and its revolutionary `T` type.

That said, the idea behind `T` is that it would be compatible across libraries. Until such time as the community-driven `alias` feature being added to an upcoming release of golang is available, packages which implement their own `T` type will find it incompatible with other packages using a different `T`.

With that in mind, until the much sought-after `alias` feature is added to golang, I would suggest individuals import the library at this time so as to maintain full compatibility across the golang universe. Until the `alias` syntax arrives, there simply is no clear way to maintain both universal compatibility, and follow Law 8.

It's my sincere hope that golanging gophers everywhere are willing to accept this temporary tradeoff. As soon as `alias` is delivered unto us, I will update this section with official guidelines and best practices on using `alias` with `T`.

# Afterword
I hope you enjoy programming with generics as much as I do. The best part about golang is the involvement of the community in shaping the future of the language. Remember:

`interface{} says nothing`

Say it with T, instead!
